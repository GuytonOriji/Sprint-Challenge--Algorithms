#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)The number of operations-->(runtime) will increase at a linear rate as the size of the input increases-->(the n). ===>{O(n)}


b)runtime complexity will be " O(n^n) " because the snippet will have nested loops. operations will increase quadratically


c)this will also be O(n) like the fisrt one but it will for each value (its like a mix of the 1st 2 but no loop)

## Exercise II
